# HTML Questions

## What does a DOCTYPE do? [[source]](https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook/blob/master/questions/html-questions.md)

* DOCTYPE is an abbreviation for DOCument TYPE.
* A DOCTYPE is associated with a DTD - Document Type Definition.
		* A document type definition defines how documents of a certain type should be structured (i.e. a button can contain a span but not a div) with a list of validated elements and attributes (examples are HTML 2.0, 4.0, XML).
	* DOCTYPE's are *required* for legacy reasons (this is [what the spec says](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#the-doctype)).
		* When omitted, browsers tend to use a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications. Including the DOCTYPE in a document ensures that the browser makes a best effort attempt at following the relevant specifications.
		* If omitted it usually (depending on the browser's implementation) it will trigger the [quirks mode](https://quirks.spec.whatwg.org/) which defines quirks in CSS and Selectors that are necessary to support for web browsers for legacy compatibility.
